node_modules/: Where all the dependencies are stored.
public/: Contains static files like index.html and vite.svg.
src/
assets/: Static files like images (e.g., react.svg).
components/
gameComponents/: Components related to the game, like Game.jsx and Cave.jsx.
surveyComponents/: Components related to the survey, like Survey1.jsx, Survey2.jsx, and Survey3.jsx.
MainComponent.jsx: Manages which component is currently active (e.g., which survey or the game). This component could be named App.jsx if it's the root component.
styles/: Contains CSS files for styling the application.
utils/: Utility functions that can be used across components.
App.jsx: Typically the root component, but in your case, it seems like MainComponent.jsx is serving that role. Ensure that App.jsx is being used appropriately (either rename MainComponent.jsx to App.jsx or use App.jsx to render MainComponent.jsx).
main.jsx: Entry point for the React application, which should render App.jsx.
Based on this structure, it looks like you're on the right track. Just ensure that:

App.jsx is indeed the root component, or it's being used to render the MainComponent.jsx. There's usually only one root component named App.jsx, and it's common to place it directly under the src/ directory, not within components/. But if MainComponent.jsx is acting as the root, consider renaming it to App.jsx for clarity.
main.jsx should contain the call to ReactDOM.render(<App />, ...) and not much else.
Your React component imports in main.jsx (or App.jsx) reflect the new structure. For example:
jsx
