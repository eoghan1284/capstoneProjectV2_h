Initialize Project Settings:

2 done
Set up your package.json with any additional scripts or dependencies you may need.
Configure vite.config.js if you have any specific configurations for Vite, such as aliases or plugins.
Update .eslintrc.js to match your preferred linting rules.
Set Up Styles:

3 done
Write the basic styles in index.css and App.css. This way, you can ensure that your global styles or resets are applied from the start.
Create Utility Functions:

4 done
If you have a clear idea of the utility functions needed, you can start writing dataModel.js within the utils folder. These might include data transformations, validators, or helper functions.
Write Component Logic:

5
Start with MainComponent.jsx. As the orchestrator of your application flow, getting this structure right is crucial. Define your state, handlers, and the conditional rendering logic.
Write the App.jsx component, which will render MainComponent.jsx. App.jsx is usually the top-level component in your application.

6
Move on to the individual components within the components/surveyComponents and components/gameComponents folders.
Start with the survey components (Survey1.jsx, Survey2.jsx, Survey3.jsx), since they're likely to be the first interaction a user has with your application.
Define the forms and any state they need to handle user input.
Implement the logic for proceeding to the next survey or step.
After the surveys, work on the gameComponents like Game.jsx and Cave.jsx. Flesh out the game mechanics and rendering logic.
Integrate Assets:

7
If your components use assets like images, import them into the respective components where they're needed.
Ensure that react.svg (and any other assets) are referenced correctly in the components that use them.
Test Components Individually:

8
As you complete each component, test them individually. You can import and render them temporarily in App.jsx for isolation testing.
Main Entry Point (main.jsx):

9
Ensure main.jsx is correctly bootstrapping your React app by rendering the App component.
Public Assets:

10
Update index.html in the public folder to make sure it's pointing to the correct entry point and has the correct links to your assets.
Backend Server (Optional):

11
If server.js is intended to be part of the backend or serve the application, set that up according to your backend logic.
